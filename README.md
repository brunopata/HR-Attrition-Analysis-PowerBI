# 🔍 **Employee Attrition – HR Insights with Power BI**  
> ##### Data used was taken from the [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)

## 📊 ***Overview:***
In this project, I analyzed employee attrition data to help HR teams identify key drivers of turnover and retention. I built an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes employee metrics across departments, roles, satisfaction levels, and tenure to uncover patterns in attrition behavior.

## 🔧 ***Tools Used:***
- **Power BI**  
- **DAX** (measures, calculated columns, dynamic filters)  
- **Microsoft Excel** (data prep)  
- **Data Modeling & Relationships**
- **Data Visualization & Storytelling**

## 📈 ***Dashboard Highlights:***  
  
### 🧾 **KPI Cards:**  
  - **Attrition Rate**  
  - **Average Monthly Income**  
  - **Average Job Satisfaction**  
  - **Average Tenure**
  
### 🧪 **Filters & Slicers:**  
  - Gender, Age, Department, Role, Education, Overtime   
  - Work/Life Balance, Job & Environment Satisfaction
  
### 📊 **Key Visuals:**  
  - Attrition % by **Department** and **Job Role**  
  - Attrition by **Overtime** and **Tenure**  
  - **Scatterplot**: Job Satisfaction vs Years at Company  
  - **Donut Chart**: Overall Employee vs Attrition Breakdown  
  - **Bar Chart**: Attrition trends across employee segments  
  
## 🎯 ***Key Features:***
- **Interactive drilldowns** by Department, Role, Tenure and Satisfaction  
- **Tooltip-enhanced charts** for detailed metric exploration  
- **Responsive slicers** for customized anmalysis by demographics  
- **Clean layout & visual hierarchy** for executive-readability  
- **DAX-driven KPIs** and conditional formatting  

## 💡 ***Key Insights:***
- **Overtime** is a strong driver of attrition - employees working overtime leave more frequently.  
- **Satisfaction metrics** (job, environment, work/life balance) are closely tied to retention.
- **Sales roles** experience the **highest attrition rate**, while **R&D has the highest turnover volume**.  
- **Attrition is most common during the first year** of employment.

## 🧠 ***Business Value***
This dashboard helps HR leaders:
- Identify **retention risks early**
- Prioritize improvements to **satisfaction drivers**
- Monitor attrition trends by role and demographic
- Support **data-driven talent strategies**
