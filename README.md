> ##### Data used was taken from the [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)

### 📊 *Overview:*
In this project I have analyzed employee attrition data to help HR teams identify key drivers of employee turnover. I built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize metrics and analyze attrition based on department, job role, overtime, tenure and satisfaction patterns.

### 🔧 *Tools Used:*
- Power BI  
- DAX  
- Microsoft Excel  
- Data Modeling & Visualization  

### 📈 *Dashboard Highlights:*
- **KPI Cards:**  
  - Overall Attrition Rate, Average Job Satisfaction, Income & Tenure  
- **Filters & Slicers:**  
  - Gender, Age, Department, Overtime, Satisfaction Levels, etc...  
- **Key Visuals:**  
  - Attrition by Department, Role, Tenure  
  - Job Satisfaction vs. Years at Company
  - Overtime trends and Work/Life Balance Impact
  
### 🎯 *Key Features:*
- Overall attrition KPIs and department-level breakdowns  
- Drill-downs by Role, Tenure, Satisfaction and Overtime status  
- Interactive slicers to explore Gender, Age, Education and more  
- Trend visualizations and detailed tooltips for deeper insights
  
### 🧠 *Key Insights:*
- Employees that work Overtime are more likely to leave.
- Satisfaction scores (Job, Environment, Work/Life Balance) strongly correlate with attrition.
- Sales show the highest turnover rates.
- R&D roles show the highest turnover count.
- Tenure shows higher attrition below 1 year.
